    <h2>Puerto Rican Alcapuria (fritters)</h2>
    <p>This a famous dish from the island of Puerto Rico.
        A dish I happen to love very much, so much,
        in fact, that I will be teaching myself how to prepare the dish. 
        To prepare the dish I'll need to find a local Latin market to find the necessary ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>sofrito (puertorican seasoning)</li>
        <li>ground beef</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>pimento-stuffed olives</li>
        <li>sazon seasoning</li>
        <li>adobo seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>dough</h3>>
    <ul>
        <li>green plantains</li>
        <li>yucca</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>sazon seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with 4 tbsp of sofrito in a hot pan over medium heat. 
            Once fragrant, add in ground beef and simmer until beef is fully cooked.
            Add the tomato sauce and cook another 10 minutes. 
            Add in olives and all seasonings and mix until evenly combined</li>
        <li>Make the masa (dough). In your food processor,
            combine the yucca and plantain pieces and pulse
            until a smooth and consistent dough is formed. 
            Add in the achiote oil and sazon and pulse a 
            few more times to combine.</li>
        <li>Prep the masa. Cut out squares of parchment paper. 
            One at a time, spray a square with nonstick cooking spray, 
            add a ½ cup scoop of the masa dough and spread out flat with
            a spatula.</li>
        <li>Fill the alcapurrias. Next top the masa with a few small
            spoonfuls of the picadillo filling, making sure to add 
            a small enough amount that you have a few inches of dough
            around all edges of the filling.</li>
        <li>Close the fritters. Using the parchment paper & spatula,
            carefully fold the masa over the filling, spreading the
            edges until fully sealed and no picadillo is visible.
            Continue this process until you’ve used all of your dough and/or filling.</li>
        <li>Fry. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed,
            wide mouthed pan. Fry the Alcapurria at 350
            degrees over medium heat until golden brown and crisp all around.
            Cool on a paper towel lined plate and enjoy!</li>
